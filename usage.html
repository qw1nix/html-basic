    <h2>Usage</h2>
            <div class="usage">General way to run all cypress tests to run <mark>npx cypress run</mark> command. This command will run all existing test spec headless in electron browser at staging environment, using Api login method by default. General way to open cypress GUI is to run <mark>npx cypress open</mark> command.
        </div>
            <div class="package-json"> <mark>package.json</mark> file in <mark>"scripts":</mark> property contains ready to use commands for some mostly used cases. For example <mark>npm run cy:open</mark> command will open cypress GUI, <mark>npm run cy:chrome_headed_prod_api</mark> will run all tests in chrome headed browser at production environment, using Api login method etc.
        </div>
            <h3>Development flow</h3>
                <div class="development">We don't have strict rules for our development flow. Everything is pretty standard:
            </div>
            <div class="ticket">
                <ol>
                    <li>You branching from master (always push empty branch after its creation, it will be a signal that you at least started work on a ticket)</li>
                    <li>If you develop test / framework feature - name branch in next notation feature/your_name/jira_ticket_id (for example, feature/Ernst/QA-666)</li>
                <div class="hotfix">
                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li>If you developing hotfix -> hotfix/your_name/ticket_name_OR_hotfix_name</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                    <li>Assign at least 2 reviewers for your pull request. Get at least 2 approvals..</li>
                    <li>If you are implementing test case with export document verification, then 'it's title HAVE TO contain 'Check export' string in exact this state! And spec name HAS TO contain .export. in it's name, for example: QA-4667.export.spec.ts</li>
                    <li>If you want to add improvements into someone's PR - branch from feature branch, make changes and create to PR into parents branch (naming: feature/your_name/ticket_id__pr_changes). You can commit into someones branch, but you are allowed to do that in exceptional cases (for example, PR almost merged and you need to run and apply ESLint changes)</li>
                    <li>When you got approvals - merge branch by yourself or ping someone who was a reviewer.</li>
                    <li>Use the pull request template to create PR, it is NECESSARY to check only 1 environment checkbox to trigger pull_request_check workflow appropriately. If you choose to run your tests on custom env, paste the link to customEnvLink URL section. This will trigger to run tests from your PR to check, if they work. Workflow for PR will run ONLY if you label it with ready_for_review label, it won't run even if you create pull request without this label</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
    <h4>NOTE:</h4>
            <div class="note">
                <ul>
                    <li>please, while developing anything - run <mark>npm run tsc:watch</mark> command in separate terminal instance (or split terminal into two). This will make TypeScript compilier keep an eye on your files changes and alert you when you forget, for example, update methods names after merge.</li>
                    <li>please, when writing commit message - add something meaningful, rather than "added some code". Good commit message: "[QA-something] added new actions into module_name" / "[misc] linter fixes". Bad commit message: "upd" / "fix"</li>
                    <li>(ernst): I do not force to use small commits instead of big ones, but when commit something - think what you would do with the big one if you have to revert / reset or cherry-pick it.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
    <h3>CLI flags</h3>
        <div class="flag">About cypress command line and it's general flags can be read <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line">here</a>. 
            </div>
                <br>
        <div class="project">Project's specific environment variables for <mark>--env</mark> flag: 
            </div>
            <div class="values">
                <ol>
                    <li><mark>url=</mark> - accepts values <mark>dev</mark>,<mark>prod</mark> or <mark>staging</mark> for development, production or staging environment. Example of usage: <mark>npx cypress run --env url=prod</mark> will run tests at production environment. If this variable was not passed, uses <mark>staging</mark> by default.</li>
                    <li><mark>loginMethod=</mark> - accepts values <mark>ui</mark> or <mark>api</mark> for login by UI or Api. Example of usage: <mark>npx cypress run --env loginMethod=ui</mark> will launch tests with login by UI. If this variable was not passed, uses <mark>api</mark> by default. Example of combining previous variables: <mark>npx cypress run --env url=dev,loginMethod=ui</mark> will launch tests at development environment with login by UI.</li>
                    <li><mark>customEnv=</mark> - accepts url to specific branch environment. Example of usage: <mark>npx cypress run --env customEnv=https://someUrl/to/env</mark> will launch tests at this environment.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        <h3>GH Actions debug</h3>
            <div class="action">If your task will be connected with GH Actions changes or you would like to check how your newly implemnted test can behave in GH Actions - you should use <a href="https://github.com/nektos/act">act</a> , rather then commit a lot of times into the repo and trigger the real pipeline.
                </div>
            <div class="main-flow">Main flow of how we use act for this repo - described in txt file in <a href="https://github.com/JLBLine/PUMA/blob/master/install_notes.txt">these notes</a> .
                </div>
        <h3>Validation of export</h3>
            <div class="export">Since we have a lot of test cases which has validation of Report Export (it will <mark>*.docx</mark> file) - we had to find the way we could automate these checks somehow.
                </div>
            <div class="automation">We found a way we can somehow automate it - we convert <mark>docx</mark> file into html and then open it in Cypress.
                </div>
            <div class="code-tests">You can refer to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/79703">QA-4053 spec</a> to see the code of such tests.
                </div>
        <h5>Flow for ReportExport checks</h5>
            <div class="report-export">
                <ol>
                <li>(1st <mark>it</mark> in <mark>describe</mark>) Your test creates report.</li>
                <li>(1st <mark>it</mark> in <mark>describe</mark>) Your test downloads report. Report has <mark>job_id.docx</mark> name and stored in <mark>cypress/download</mark>. Inside method <mark>downloadAndConvertDocxReport()</mark> we call several tasks (code which executes in nodejs): wait until file showed up in filesystem -> we convert docx into html -> we rename docx file from <mark>job_id.docx</mark> to <mark>QA-test_case_number.docx</mark> -> we rename html file from <mark>job_id.html</mark> to <mark>QA-test_case_number.html</mark></li>
                <li>(2nd <mark>it</mark> in <mark>describe</mark>) important Before calling <mark>cy.task("getFilePath")</mark> to get the path of your html report - you will need explicitly change <mark>baseUrl</mark> in <mark>cypress.json</mark> by adding next line:</li>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    Cypress.config().baseUrl = null;
                </pre>
            </code>
                <div class="base-url">This will set baseUrl of <mark>cypress.json</mark> to <mark>null</mark> and reload browser's window, which eventually made possible to navigate to static html page in filesystem. Without it - Cypress will consider relative path of html report as path to web resource (will navigate to <mark>http://baseUrl.com/cypress/downloads/TestAutoReport-QA-4719 - 462 1st Avenue, Manhattan, NY 10016.docx.html</mark> , for example).
                </div>
                <li>(2nd <mark>it</mark> in <mark>describe</mark>) Your test opens generated html report in Cypress (Cypress can't (well, until <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/releases/tag/v9.6.0">release 9.6.0</a> ) <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security#Same-superdomain-per-test">visit other origin url</a> )</li>
                <li>(2nd <mark>it</mark> in <mark>describe</mark>) Your test makes traverse and assert on generated html report.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h3>Env selection (dev/staging/prod/custom)</h3>
            <div class="env">For dynamic <mark>baseUrl</mark> set we use <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables">Cypress env variables</a> and access to <mark>config</mark> from <mark>setupNodeEvents</mark> (yeah, since Cypress 10 released - a lot of changed).
        </div>
            <div class="reassignment">Basically what we do - we reassign <mark>baseUrl</mark> during runtime here:
        </div>
        <code>
            <pre>
                config.baseUrl = evalUrl(config);
            </pre>
        </code>
            <div class="information">If want more details on hot it works - dive into <mark>evalUrl</mark> function.
        </div>
        <h5>How to use:</h5>
            <div class="urls">Pass <mark>--env url=key_of_the_env</mark> (urls and their keys defined in <a href="https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers-ens/blob/master/src.ts/index.ts">ENVS</a>)
        </div>
            <div class="gui">Opens Cypress GUI with dev url:
        </div>
        <code>
            <pre>
                npm run cy:open -- --env url=dev
            </pre>
        </code>
            <div class="gui-custom">Opens Cypress GUI with custom url:
        </div>
        <code>
            <pre>
                npm run cy:open -- --env url=custom,customUrl='https://playwright.dev'
            </pre>
        </code>
            <div class="ci"><b>The same approach</b> remains for <mark>npx cypress run</mark> and CI runs.
        </div>
            <div class="info-about-ci">In CI we have check whether <mark>url==custom</mark> and in that case assign <mark>customUrl</mark>.
        </div>
            <div class="dynamically-set-url">Previously, we were selecting specific url to run the tests with help of <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables">Cypress environmental variables</a>, but our <mark>baseUrl</mark> in <mark>cypress.json</mark> wasn't set. It <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices#Setting-a-global-baseUrl">wasn't a good approach</a>, but it allowed us dynamically set the url to visit and url for api requests. <b>BUT ALSO</b> our <mark>before/beforeEach</mark> hooks were executing two time (two time of login through api). And if we would try to create report - we would create two report and were working in the second one.
        </div>
        <h3>AWS secrets (User Roles and etc)</h3>
            <div class="secret">We have tests which requires login as specific user (Lead Appraiser, Appraiser user, Admin and etc), you can find them by <mark>@permissions_roles</mark> tag.
        </div>
            <div class="json">We could've store these secrets in GH Actions secrets, but in that case we won't have an option to edit them (especially, if we store a pretty big <mark>json</mark> ).  
        </div>
            <div class="aws-secret-manager">That's why we need AWS Secret Manager. We set there secret <mark>Github/Cypress/User_Roles</mark> which store data about User Roles (their usernames and passwords). If you want to edit/add secrets:
        </div>
        <div class="google-saml-power-user-role">
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to the AWS (use AWS SSO, which you can find in <mark>Google apps</mark> in your Bowery Gmail account).</li>
                    <li>Select <mark>GoogleSAMLPowerUserRole</mark> in <mark>bowery-prod</mark> section.</li>
                    <li>Find AWS Secret Manager in Search and navigate there.</li>
                    <li>Paste secret name you want to edit or create your own (IMPORTANT: Naming convention for such secrets should be next - Github/Cypress/**, like <mark>Github/Cypress/User_Roles</mark> ).</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="user-code">Code of custom action can be found <a href="https://github.com/Bowery-RES/action-run-e2e-tests">here</a>. Flow of credentials exposing into execution environment (this is why we don't need to write or somehow add secret info into codebase):
        </div>   
        <div class="prefix">
            <ol>
                <li>Connect to AWS Secret Manager (step "Configure secrets") from allowed GH repository (private info, configurable by privacy policy in AWS) with specific role (public info).</li>
                <li>Reading AWS secrets and emmiting them into environment (step "Set secrets to GH environment") That's why Cypress-specific creds need to have <mark>CYPRESS_</mark> prefix to be accessible with <mark>Cypress.env</mark> method).</li>
                <li>That's it! Variables was read from AWS and set to the environment in runtime. From that moment they are accessible to our test.</li>
            </ol>
